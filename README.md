# Overview
This is a simple project to transform the session data from the [CodeMash API](https://github.com/argodev/codemash-speakers/blob/master/api/README.md) into a form where I can see all the sessions in each time block and decide which one I'd rather attend.

The code is implemented as a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and uses [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for the data manipulation part.

I performed this work against the CodeMash 2018 session data.  If the JSON structure changes in future years, this code may no longer work.
